# Turn into a pumpkin

This is a short script for AWS to downsize a box after a heavy job has finished.

## Example usage

To turn into a pumpkin after a long job:

    ./long_job.sh && pumpkin

To turn into a big pumpkin immediately:

    pumpkin m4.10xlarge

## The problem

  I used to have to manually resize my development EC2 box, which is a comically tedious process:

1. Go to AWS console
2. Type in password
3. Take out phone, type in 2FA
4. Open EC2 instances tab
5. Find my node in the list
6. Shut it down
7. Wait for it to shut down
8. Right click and change the type
9. Restart the box
10. Wait for it to boot

  Instead, I wanted a script that could do all this for me.

## Implementation

  Amazon provides a CLI tool for most of the services, which is capable of resizing a box; however,
it is not able to resize a box that is running; you can't resize yourself.

  To work around this, you can spin up a new temporary box, which can shut down the dev box, resize
and restart it from a script, and then clean up after itself.
